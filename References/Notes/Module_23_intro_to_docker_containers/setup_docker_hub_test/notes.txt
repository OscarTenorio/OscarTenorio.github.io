To add to docker hub:
    - NOTE: first you should go to https://hub.docker.com and create a file. Created my username as "oscartenorio", so wherever you see that in further notes just know that's your username
    - Navigate to root of project that you want to put up into docker hub
    - Run:
        docker build -t oscartenorio/project_name .
        -----a------ -b -----c-----  -----d------ -e
        a. command to create the docker container
        b. adds a tag
        c. corresponds to your docker hub username (must make an account first for this to work)
        d. name of the project (it'll be in the url later)
        e. not sure, but I think it runs the application once built or something?
- this will upload an image of your project to docker hub, where you can send the URL to anyone (I gugess depending on privacy/permission settings) and have them run your code

To test that it worked:
    - Run (from the same place in the directory as above, I think):
        docker run -p 8080:3000 --name project_nameInstance -t oscartenorio/project_name
        -----a---- -b -c-- --d- ---e-- --------f----------  ------------g---------------
        a. run command
        b. port tag
        c. port to expose on your machine (D1 local)
        d. port inside of the container
        e. name tag
        f. the name of the container / name of the instanced image (notice the naming convention, so like "exampleInstance" or "myProjectInstance")
        g. destination to run from (same that we created above)

See generalNotes.txt file (at the root of this github directory I believe) for much more thorough notes
