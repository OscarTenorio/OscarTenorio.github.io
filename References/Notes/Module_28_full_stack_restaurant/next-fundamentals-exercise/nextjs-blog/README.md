This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

This is the command run in terminal to generate the example Next JS app:
    npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/master/basics/learn-starter"

Might want to check this site in case the ggithub link changed (it changed since the class video was made):

^ that is also the tutorial that we're following for these first few videos in this week's module
