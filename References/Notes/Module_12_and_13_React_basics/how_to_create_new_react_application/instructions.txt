--------------CREATING A REACT APP--------------
------------------------------------------------

~~~ WITHOUT USING TOOLCHAIN ~~~

Run the following commands in the Terminal to intialize a new React application:

1. mkdir new-react-app-name
   cd  new-react-app-name
   npm intit

   (this creates the directory, moves you into that folder, then uses npm to initialize a package.json file (you can provide the name and version here))

2. npm install react react-dom

   (this will install react and react-dom packages, by creating a node_modules folder with all dependent libraries to further add dependency inside the package.json file) 

3. touch .gitignore

   (creates a .gitignore file, to avoid pushing unnecessary files to GitHub) 

4. mkdir app

   (creates an app directory to hold most of the React files) 

5. cd app
   touch index.js
   touch index.css
   touch index.html

   (moves you into the app folder, then creates the basic files you'll need to get started)

6. npm install --save -dev @babel/core @babel/preset/env @babel/react webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server babel-loader css-loader style-loader html-webpack-plugin

   (uses npm to install all of these dependencies(?) needed to run react) 

TODO: add steps for the following:
    1. Edit the Webpack configuration
    2. Get the babel-loader to work
    3. Add the Webpack script to the package.json




~~~ USING TOOLCHAIN ~~~

1. npx create-react-app new-react-app-name

   (As you can see, way easier. This auto-generates all of your files and handles the configurations and dependencies. When generating a new file or component, create-react-app will handle any configuration changes or file imports that need to happen for your application to work)

   (You can look for the react_with_toolchain folder somewhere in the Practice folder to see what it looks like once the above commands have been executed)
