Look in the App.test.js file for details on what this folder is about - Jest (Javascript testing language) tests for the react app

- note that as prt of the 20.19 video, I've added an api.js file that simulates a response from an API and made changes to App.test.js - all these have been commented out to not disrupt the app.
